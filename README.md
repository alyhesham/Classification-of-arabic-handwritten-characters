# Classification-of-arabic-handwritten-characters

This is simple client-server application for classifying the ahcd1 dataset found on kaggle 
it uses a neural network implemented from scratch to classify the images. The store.pckl file has the weights of the neural network after training with the training data instead of traing every time to test a new image.


steps to run:

1) run the main_server file first

2) edit the my_file.txt file to add the photo which you want to predict

3) run the client file then wait for output

to try other files repeat steps 2 and 3

Sample images that were not used in training are in the test_data folder
